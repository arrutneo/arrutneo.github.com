#Hyperlink

Just take a look at your `<body>`

your *attributes* are stunning

you'r a *meta* in my `<head>`

an `<img>` within my bed.

<br>

Let us write a `<b>` `<legend>`

life is a `<canvas>` at the end.

More than just a `<p>`

I'd prefer it `<strong>` not decaf.

<br>

Wanna come to my `<table>`?

I do have some blue `<label>`

who needs `<abbreviation>`?

eyes started the `<nav>`.
